## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning PHP, Symfony, and Go. 
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m working on an exciting project to help me stay organized in my quest to land a developer job!
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on team projectsâ€”coding and learning together is so much more fun!
- âš¡ Fun fact: My cat loves walking in front of the webcam during my calls!

Have a great day! ðŸ˜Š
