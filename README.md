## Hi there 👋

- 🌱 I’m currently working with JavaScript/TypeScript, PHP, Symfony, and I am learning Go. 
- 🔭 I’m working on an exciting project to help me stay organized in my quest to land a developer job!
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on team projects—coding and learning together is so much more fun!
- ⚡ Fun fact: My cat loves walking in front of the webcam during my calls!

Have a great day! 😊
